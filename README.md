# MICRO FRONTENDS AND THE MULTIVERSE OF FRAMEWORKS

One of the most frequent challenges for frontend engineers is the need to make your framework work with multiple libraries, different versions, or even other frameworks. The traditional micro frontend approach allows us to divide the work and scale through numerous teams, using different URLs per app, but bringing multiple frameworks together on the same page without issues has been hard to achieve until now.
This repository presents an elegant solution combining Micro Frontends + Module Federation + Web components that will allow your base app to work with any other framework/library on the same page. I believe this architecture will be extremely useful for any frontend developer, and even allow teams that have different framework preferences to collaborate on a single web app.
